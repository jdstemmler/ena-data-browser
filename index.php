                    Welcome to the data browser for the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement's 
                    Eastern North Atlantic permanent site. This site is created and maintained
                    by Jayson Stemmler of the University of Washington 
                    (<a href="mailto:jstemm@uw.edu">jstemm@uw.edu</a>). You should send him any
                    questions or issues you have, not ARM.

                <h2>How to use this site</h2>

                <p>
                    This site provides quick and easy access to a number of data products from the
                    permanent ARM site in the ENA. The data used in the visualizations were downloaded
                    from the ARM Data Archive, which can be accessed through the "Order ENA Data" in
                    the navigation menu.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I will provide more information about the use of this site as I build out the 
                    functionality of the site. Right now, I don't quite know how it's going to work.
                </p>
